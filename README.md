Hi there!

I'm intensively learning to code and interested in data science, aiming to be hired by the end of 2020.
This repository is for completed projects and code snippets from Codecademy Computer Science Career Path

With The Computer Science Career Path I've learned, practiced and successfully applied following skills & topics:

Command Line Commands
Learn Git Course
Python 3
Python Objects and Classes
Linear Data Structures
Complex Data Structures
Asymptotic Notation
Recursion with Python
Sorting Algorithms with Python
Search Algorithms with Python
Graph Search Algorithms
List of projects:

Shipping Costs Calculator -- prints shipping tariffs in a table view, takes weight of a parcel as a user's input, calculates shipping costs for different shipping methods and returns the most cost-effective shipping solution.
Symbols Stats -- reads a txt file provided as an optional argument when running the script, parses the file and calculates frequency of each symbol occurances, prints each symbol ranked based on its occurance in the text from the most frequent to the least frequent, shows the total amount of symbols in the file.
Words Stats -- reads a txt file provided as an optional argument when running the script, parses the file and calculates frequency of each word occurances, prints each word and number of times it appeared in the text ranked based on its occurance from the most frequent to the least frequent, shows the total amount of words in the file.
Daily Sales -- reads a sales data from a txt file, cleans imported data, prints cleared sales data in a tabular view, calculates and prints daily sales statistics (total number of transactions, gross sales, smallest purchase, largest purchase, average purchase, median purchase), calculates and prints sales stats by product category of sold items.
Plural Nouns -- takes user input of comma separated list of nouns to pluralize them according to English language grammar rules. The script uses elif statements and a dictionary of irregular nouns to produce correct plural form. The output is in a tabular view.
Conjugate Me -- takes user input of comma separated list of verbs in infinitive form to conjugate them according to English language grammar rules. The script uses elif statements and a complete dictionary of 478 irregular verbs to produce correct conjugations. The output is in a tabular view.
Censor Engine -- reads a text file, asks a user which words (or set of digits) to be replaced, pluralizes user specified nouns, conjugates user defined verbs and replaces all their forms by a user defined symbol in the text read from a file, prints out the censored text with all the substitutions made and writes it into a new file in the working directory.
Days Count -- prints out an info about today and the current year progress status or tells a user how many days are left till user's birthday and how young is the user based on the user's input.
